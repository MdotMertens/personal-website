I admit, I am often out of my head, analysing and overthinking.

In the last couple of weeks I've made the decision to trust my gut a bit more and actively chose things that I believe in and that make me happy.

So far it's been paying off. I hope this is not seasonal depression leaving me and that the effects last.
